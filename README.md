## Technologies Used

- **Outsystems Integration Studio**: Integration with external services and extensions

## How to Try

2. Upload the `MediPointment.oap` and `ConverterUTF8.xif` files from the project. **Note:** The first file is the application, but the second is an important extension that must be implemented in **Outsystems Integration Studio** for the program to work correctly.
3. Publish and run the application in your Outsystems environment.
